## Requirements

- A Graphics Card that supports Vulkan 1.3* or later.
- [Fabric loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)

## Steps:

There are none! Simply download the mod from one of the download buttons above and then move the JAR file into your **mods** folder like any other mod.

## Compatibility

Mod compatibility is not guaranteed. When VulkanMod is loaded, mods that make explicit calls to OpenGL will crash the game.
Check [Incompatible mods](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod/discussions/226) list to make sure you are not using one of them.

## Known Issues

- Linux and macOS may not work. We are working on ways to improve those platforms.

- Most mods that affect rendering in any way are likely to not work with this mod. Read note one for more info.

- Custom launchers are not recommended as they can cause issues with this mod. We are working on better compat for this but support is not guaranteed. 

## Notes
- If you come across any mod that do not work with this mod, please create an issue inside **this** repo and **do not** report it to the mod developer.

- If you need support/help with VulkanMod, or simply want to know when updates are released, you can join our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/EDgQ88tJAk).
